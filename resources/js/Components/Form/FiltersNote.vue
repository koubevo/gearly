    <SmallText>Filters are optional, but using them can help your items get noticed faster and improve your chances of selling. 
        Plus, they make it easier for buyers to find exactly what theyâ€™re looking for. If a specific filter is missing, 
        feel free to include any extra details in the description. <span class="font-bold">Filters are available only for certain categories of products.</span></SmallText>
